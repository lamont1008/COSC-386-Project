	Students will use this database by either searching through it to look at information
	about specific clubs or the student will be able to do a survey that could be used to help them
	find clubs that they may be interested in using information about student likes and club interests
	to find potential matches. Specified users, such as: university staff, the database creators, and
	club officers, would be allowed to change the stored information about the clubs, what students
	are in them, and any other relevant data.
	<br><br>	
	The interface focuses on ease of use for the intended users. There will be a tab for home,
	search, survey, and contacts. There will be an additional button for login which will be used for
	those with privileged access.
	<br><br>	
	Above all, we hope that this provides students with personalized recommendations to help them get 
	involved in the SU community.
